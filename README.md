# Sales Forecasting Project

Welcome to the Sales Forecasting project repository! This project predicts sales using various techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Feedforward Neural Networks. The dataset used is `Walmart.csv`.

## Project Overview

Sales forecasting is a critical aspect of retail operations. This project aims to provide accurate predictions for future sales based on historical data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Feedforward Neural Networks, the project seeks to optimize forecasting accuracy.
